## RPG Progression
### What is it?

A game is based on a combination of challenges and/or options that are offered to the player so that he can overcome them. Correct progression means that these challenges start with something simple and end with something complex, changing their complexity to adapt them at all times to the player's abilities, while at the same time forcing the player to improve those abilities.

In competitive online games this is very different, since the game does not guide you, but in cooperatives it can be applied correctly, as well as in 1-player adventure games. In this article I will focus on the progression of RPG games.

In the case of RPGs, moreover, progression prevents the player from perceiving the game as repetitive, since they are usually quite long games with a combat system that does not vary. Indeed, it could be considered that these games are based on progression and revolve around it, since players always seek to increase their various statistics in the most optimal way possible, which is fully regulated by the game's progression system.

In addition, an important factor that must always be taken into account when designing the progress of a game is that the actions of the player in each zone must be foreseen and controlled, as well as their possible thoughts (if they first try to pass through one area or another, etc.) and the emotions that can be caused by the situations of each zone (frustration, comfort, curiosity, etc.).

## Learning Phase

The first thing is to teach the player **how to play**.

In the case of complex games like many RPGs, it is often important not to show all the information, stats, etc. to the player at the very beginning because so much information could overwhelm him (or, even if it is shown, not asking him to take it all into account from the start). The ideal thing to do is to progressively distribute the explanations of the game during a **learning phase**, of greater or lesser duration depending on the game, its audience, etc.

In a game that offers many options to the player (when it comes to fighting, equipping, upgrading the character, etc.) this phase can start by showing basic mechanics to solve simple and essential problems in the game (always showing the player what is what you want to achieve by using them). Gradually, other concepts can be explained, from the most relevant in the game to, finally, the most secondary or things designed for an experienced player who wants to get the most out of the experience. Ideally, all this should be taught (at least at the beginning) by explaining the concepts in the most synthesized and **clear** way possible and making the player **interact** with them and put them into practice to reinforce them.

On the other hand, if the concepts are simple and/or the game is aimed at an audience that understands them easily, perhaps a little initial explanation is enough.

In any case, it is always useful that the player can review these concepts at any time from an in-game menu.

In addition, many games, after explaining their concepts to the player, makes them test what they have learn with a small challenge at the end of this learning phase. In this, the player has to prove that he has understood everything that has been explained to him and put it together to overcome the challenge.

Finally, once this initiation phase is over, many games make alterations to their concepts during mid-game.
If the game allows it, even if the difficulty itself is not scaled, it is good that in different areas the player gets the possibility of using the mechanics that they already know but in a different way, adapting to that area, being something typical of that zone and it is only useful for this specific one. This is an optional feature, but it adds more variety to the game because it temporarily breaks the monotony of using the same system throughout the game.

## The difficulty curve:

Once the player has acquired the necessary knowledge, the difficulty curve begins. This is very important because it is responsible for leading the pace of the game and guiding the player using his emotions, keeping him attached to the game and making him not feel monotony or repetition.

As the curve is so important, if it is not well designed, the player can very easily perceive that the game is not balanced enough or that it is directly unfair, which frustrates him and will surely make him stop playing.

The difficulty curve is also essential because it marks the progression in the game. If the difficulty were fixed throughout the experience, one of two things would probably happen:


1. it’s too difficult for the player at first, and because he hasn’t been able to adapt slowly, he can’t move forward in the game and stops playing.
2. it’s too easy and the player gets bored after a while as he looks for challenges.

As I mentioned before, the difficulty has to accompany the player throughout the game and guide him. Treating it as a metaphor, we can imagine that it is a babysitter who takes a child by the hand through a park so that they does not get lost or hurt. It will take the child to a rocker, then to a swing, and so on. and the child will gradually climb into more dangerous attractions and lose their fear, but will not take them on a zip line at first because perhaps:
1. They don't dare and wants to leave the park
2. If they use it, they may be so scared that they don't want to know anything about the park again.
It can also happen that the babysitter all the time makes them jump on a small children's slide and they end up getting tired.

What we want is to give the player the feeling that he is overcoming increasingly difficult obstacles when they are presented to him, while learning and increasing his ability to be prepared for the next, also giving relaxed and calm moments.

This, in the case of RPGs, can be done by increasing the stats of enemies each time the player advances from zone to zone. It is true that the player will also increase his stats (leveling up or equipping better objects), but what interests us is that the enemies throughout the game will do so a little faster. Thus, the player will gradually come to the idea that if he wants to continue defeating enemies, the best is to try more complex strategies and try to further optimize his use of the mechanics of the game.

In case the player is unable or unwilling to use this strategic section, he always has the option to spend more time farming and increasing his stats.

In addition, to continue this progression, it is important that the player is rewarded each time he overcomes a major challenge. Whatever is more difficult or at greater risk of losing the player must have a better reward or loot.

This reward that the player receives (loot or skill points, for example) can lead to that, after a moment of tension such as a fight against a boss, the player has a moment of relaxation where he compares stats and thinks how to use that reward in the most profitable way, as well as see the strengths and weaknesses of his current strategy and consider whether to change it. It is still a very interesting part of the game and in many cases complicated, but it does not present the tension of a fight and is therefore a good point of relaxation for the player.

This is more or less what we expect to cause:

In addition, a trick is to gradually increase the tension and relaxation that is achieved in the peaks of the graph, in this way:

Talking about difficulty, the simplest and most standard difficulty curve would be this (from easy to most difficult following a linear increment):

If, on the other hand, the game is intended to be very accessible and easy at first but requires a great deal of mastery at the end to overcome it, a scheme like the following would be used:

To further improve the starting curve, we can add a decrease in difficulty each time a new zone begins, as the player has to adapt.

The curve can even become sharper depending on the zones and mechanics of our game and how we want the player to advance.

Finally, if the game is focused on a specific player profile, an specific curve can be designed for him.

In general, a trajectory like this must be achieved throughout the game, which varies between highs and lows so that the player is constantly relaxing and concentrating, keeping his attention on the game without ever reaching to get bored (with very low difficulty) or to get stressed (with excessive difficulty). This is how the flow is achieved.
