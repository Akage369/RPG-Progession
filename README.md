## RPG Progression
### What is it?

A game is based on a combination of challenges and/or options that are offered to the player so that he can overcome them. Correct progression means that these challenges start with something simple and end with something complex, changing their complexity to adapt them at all times to the player's abilities, while at the same time forcing the player to improve those abilities.

In competitive online games this is very different, since the game does not guide you, but in cooperatives it can be applied correctly, as well as in 1-player adventure games. In this article I will focus on the progression of RPG games.

In the case of RPGs, moreover, progression prevents the player from perceiving the game as repetitive, since they are usually quite long games with a combat system that does not vary. Indeed, it could be considered that these games are based on progression and revolve around it, since players always seek to increase their various statistics in the most optimal way possible, which is fully regulated by the game's progression system.

In addition, an important factor that must always be taken into account when designing the progress of a game is that the actions of the player in each zone must be foreseen and controlled, as well as their possible thoughts (if they first try to pass through one area or another, etc.) and the emotions that can be caused by the situations of each zone (frustration, comfort, curiosity, etc.).
