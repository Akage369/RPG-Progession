## RPG Progression
### What is it?

A game is based on a combination of challenges and/or options that are offered to the player so that he can overcome them. Correct progression means that these challenges start with something simple and end with something complex, changing their complexity to adapt them at all times to the player's abilities, while at the same time forcing the player to improve those abilities.

In competitive online games this is very different, since the game does not guide you, but in cooperatives it can be applied correctly, as well as in 1-player adventure games. In this article I will focus on the progression of RPG games.

In the case of RPGs, moreover, progression prevents the player from perceiving the game as repetitive, since they are usually quite long games with a combat system that does not vary. Indeed, it could be considered that these games are based on progression and revolve around it, since players always seek to increase their various statistics in the most optimal way possible, which is fully regulated by the game's progression system.

In addition, an important factor that must always be taken into account when designing the progress of a game is that the actions of the player in each zone must be foreseen and controlled, as well as their possible thoughts (if they first try to pass through one area or another, etc.) and the emotions that can be caused by the situations of each zone (frustration, comfort, curiosity, etc.).

## Learning Phase

The first thing is to teach the player **how to play**.

In the case of complex games like many RPGs, it is often important not to show all the information, stats, etc. to the player at the very beginning because so much information could overwhelm him (or, even if it is shown, not asking him to take it all into account from the start). The ideal thing to do is to progressively distribute the explanations of the game during a **learning phase**, of greater or lesser duration depending on the game, its audience, etc.

In a game that offers many options to the player (when it comes to fighting, equipping, upgrading the character, etc.) this phase can start by showing basic mechanics to solve simple and essential problems in the game (always showing the player what is what you want to achieve by using them). Gradually, other concepts can be explained, from the most relevant in the game to, finally, the most secondary or things designed for an experienced player who wants to get the most out of the experience. Ideally, all this should be taught (at least at the beginning) by explaining the concepts in the most synthesized and **clear** way possible and making the player **interact** with them and put them into practice to reinforce them.

On the other hand, if the concepts are simple and/or the game is aimed at an audience that understands them easily, perhaps a little initial explanation is enough.

In any case, it is always useful that the player can review these concepts at any time from an in-game menu.

In addition, many games, after explaining their concepts to the player, makes them test what they have learn with a small challenge at the end of this learning phase. In this, the player has to prove that he has understood everything that has been explained to him and put it together to overcome the challenge.

Finally, once this initiation phase is over, many games make alterations to their concepts during mid-game.
If the game allows it, even if the difficulty itself is not scaled, it is good that in different areas the player gets the possibility of using the mechanics that they already know but in a different way, adapting to that area, being something typical of that zone and it is only useful for this specific one. This is an optional feature, but it adds more variety to the game because it temporarily breaks the monotony of using the same system throughout the game.
